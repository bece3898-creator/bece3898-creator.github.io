      <article>
        <p>Pictured above are bowls I created using old 5-gallon buckets and colorful waste from a dog toy factory. Each piece diverts plastic from landfill and gives it a new life in the form of durable, functional pet products.</p>
        <p>This project highlights my focus on circular design—taking existing waste streams and reimagining them into useful home goods for the Boulder community.</p>

      <h2>Project: Mopeds & Motorcycles</h2>
      <img src="Screenshot 2024-05-14 at 11.11.43 PM.png" alt="Restored vintage mopeds" style="width: 30%;">
      <article>
        <p>I run BoBo’s Moped Repair Shop in Boulder, CO. Over the years, I’ve repaired and sold dozens of vintage mopeds and motorcycles, from Honda Cubs to Yamaha LS2s. My shop has become both a business and a way to connect with the local community of riders.</p>
        <p>Projects often involve top-end rebuilds, carburetor tuning, and custom parts sourcing. This hands-on mechanical work is a core part of my identity as both a designer and builder.</p>

      <h2>Project: Sustainable Keychains & Accessories</h2>
      <img src="IMG_9859.JPG" alt="CU Boulder recycled keychains" style="width: 30%;">
      <article>
        <p>Using my small injection molder, I design and produce CU-themed keychains, carabiners, and other accessories made entirely from recycled university waste streams—like milk bottles from campus cafes or old 3D-print scraps. </p>
        <p>These products merge campus culture with sustainable design, showing how small-scale manufacturing can close loops in waste systems.</p>
