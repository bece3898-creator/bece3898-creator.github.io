      The colors I used in my design system, #FEFFFF, #E9EBF8, #B4B8C5, and #A5A299, reflect my personal identity and the calm, minimal design style I connect with. These tones are soft, clean, and slightly muted, which matches how I like to approach design: simple and thoughtful. The white (#FEFFFF) creates space and clarity. The light lavender-gray (#E9EBF8) adds a sense of creativity and freshness without feeling overwhelming. The blue-gray (#B4B8C5) gives a stable and balanced base, while the gray (#A5A299) adds a bit of natural warmth. Together, they feel calm and organized, which is how I want people to see my work.

      For typography, I used a bit of a funky text to reflect my out-going crazy personality. It perhaps is not the most readable, which might have been because I made the width too small. For my portfolio I will want to include another text for paragraphs and readability. However, I loved how unique this text was and on trend with current design choices.

      Accessibility did sort of shape some of my choices. Because my colors are light, I had to check contrast carefully, especially for text on the light backgrounds. In my portfolio I will want to use the darker gray (#A5A299) and blue-gray (#B4B8C5) for text on lighter areas to ensure the contrast is correct, and I kept base font sizes somewhat large. I also made sure buttons, links, and other interactive elements had clear hover and focus states so users navigating with a keyboard or screen reader can use the site. The biggest issue with my colors is the lack of contrast perhaps which could cause major contrast issues. I might need to darken the font colors slightly to make my portfolio more accessible while keeping the soft tone. This showed me that you need to make good decisions to ensure accessibility and personal style can work together.

      Building this design system showed me how connected everything is. Changing one color or style affected the entire look. It pushed me to think about the system as a whole instead of individual pages. Creating reusable color tokens, type styles, and button components helped make everything feel consistent. This will help me with my portfolio because I can use this same system to keep it unified and professional. It will be nice to have this consistent style for other projects and perhaps even my product packaging down the road. Overall, I learned that designing a website takes a lot of proper preparation to ensure quality. I previously thought you could just throw things together as you went, but that is not the case!
